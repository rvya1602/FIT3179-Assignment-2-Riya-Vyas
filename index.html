                        In 2024, Australia continued to attract a significant number of international students enrolled in 
                        tertiary education, underscoring its strong reputation as a global education hub. The majority of these 
                        students come from Asia, with <strong>China</strong> leading at <strong>189,107 students</strong>, followed closely by <strong>India</strong> with <strong> 138,373</strong>. 
                        Other Asian countries such as Nepal (65,529), the Philippines (39,223) and Vietnam (37,608) also contribute 
                        substantially, highlighting the region’s strong and growing presence in Australia’s tertiary sector.
                        In addition, nations from other continents, such as Colombia (34,224), Brazil (23,946), and the United States 
                        (7,384), show that Australia attracts students from all around the world. This<strong> widespread international 
                        participation enriches Australian campuses both culturally and academically</strong>, contributing significantly to 
                        the higher education sector and the broader economy. Overall, the data reflects that <strong>Australia remains a 
                        highly sought-after destination for students</strong>.

                        In 2021, among Australians aged 15 years and above, there were notable differences across states
                        in the proportion of the population holding a bachelor’s degree or higher. The <strong>Australian Capital
                            Territory</strong> stood out with the <strong>highest percentage at 43.0%</strong>, reflecting its
                        strong concentration of professionals and public service employees. <strong>Victoria (29.2%) and New
                            South Wales (27.8%) also had relatively high proportions</strong>, indicating a well-educated
                        population in the two largest states. <strong>Western Australia (23.8%), South Australia (22.7%),
                            and Queensland (22.1%) had moderate levels</strong>, while <strong>Tasmania (21.9%) and the
                            Northern Territory (21.5%) had the lowest percentages</strong>, suggesting smaller shares
                        of degree holders in these regions. Overall, this data highlights the variation in
                        educational attainment across Australian states and territories, with urban and
                        administrative centers showing notably higher concentrations of tertiary-educated
                        individuals.

                    In 2024, the distribution of commencing and total students across Australian universities by state shows 
                    notable trends and variations compared with 2023. <strong>New South Wales hosts some of the largest student 
                    populations, with the University of New South Wales (82,272 total students) and the University of Sydney 
                    (78,825) leading in size</strong>, and both universities saw increases in commencing students compared with 2023, 
                    particularly UNSW, which grew by 28.7%. <strong>Victoria similarly has large institutions such as Monash University 
                    (93,159 students) and The University of Melbourne (75,513)</strong>; Monash recorded a 19.1% rise in commencing students 
                    from 2023, while some smaller Victorian universities, like Federation University, experienced declines. 
                    <strong>Queensland universities show mixed trends compared with 2023, with The University of Queensland and Queensland 
                    University of Technology leading in size, but growth in commencing students ranges from small increases to 
                    slight decreases. Western Australia recorded strong growth in commencing students at some universities</strong>, 
                    including The University of Western Australia (+20.2%) and Curtin University (+15.9%) from 2023, though 
                    Murdoch University declined by 17.3%. <strong>South Australian universities mostly saw small declines or modest 
                    stability compared with 2023</strong>, while <strong>Tasmania’s University of Tasmania recorded a slight increase (+3.3%). 
                    The Northern Territory continues to have very small student populations, and the Australian Capital Territory 
                    saw declines</strong> in commencing students at both The Australian National University and University of Canberra 
                    compared with 2023. Overall, the data highlights that while Australia’s major universities continue to 
                    attract large numbers of students, the change from 2023 shows varied growth trends, reflecting differing 
                    regional dynamics and institutional appeal across the country in 2024.

                        Between <strong>2015 and 2019</strong>, Australia’s total tertiary student population grew steadily, 
                        reflecting the country’s strong appeal as an education destination. <strong>Domestic student 
                        numbers increased from 1,046,835 to 1,087,850</strong>, while <strong>international students grew even 
                        faster, from 363,298 to 521,948</strong>, highlighting the rising global demand for Australian 
                        higher education, particularly from countries such as China, India, Nepal, and Vietnam. 
                        The <strong>COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 caused a sharp decline in international students, 
                        falling to 440,309</strong>, as border closures and travel restrictions limited mobility. <strong>Domestic 
                        student numbers, however, continued to rise, reaching a peak of 1,162,260 in 2021</strong>, showing 
                        the resilience of local enrolments despite global disruption. From <strong>2022 onwards, international 
                        students returned in significant numbers, climbing to 589,288 by 2024, while domestic enrolments 
                        stabilized around 1,086,000</strong>. By 2024, the total tertiary student population reached 1,676,077, 
                        surpassing pre-pandemic levels. This trajectory illustrates not only a robust post-pandemic 
                        recovery but also the continued global attractiveness of Australia’s higher education sector, 
                        emphasizing the combined economic, cultural, and social contributions of both domestic and 
                        international students to the country.
