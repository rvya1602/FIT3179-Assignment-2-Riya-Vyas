                        In 2024, Australia continued to attract a significant number of international students enrolled in 
                        tertiary education, underscoring its strong reputation as a global education hub. The majority of these 
                        students come from Asia, with <strong>China</strong> leading at <strong>189,107 students</strong>, followed closely by <strong>India</strong> with <strong> 138,373</strong>. 
                        Other Asian countries such as Nepal (65,529), the Philippines (39,223) and Vietnam (37,608) also contribute 
                        substantially, highlighting the region’s strong and growing presence in Australia’s tertiary sector.
                        In addition, nations from other continents, such as Colombia (34,224), Brazil (23,946), and the United States 
                        (7,384), show that Australia attracts students from all around the world. This<strong> widespread international 
                        participation enriches Australian campuses both culturally and academically</strong>, contributing significantly to 
                        the higher education sector and the broader economy. Overall, the data reflects that <strong>Australia remains a 
                        highly sought-after destination for students</strong>.

                        In 2021, among Australians aged 15 years and above, there were notable differences across states
                        in the proportion of the population holding a bachelor’s degree or higher. The <strong>Australian Capital
                            Territory</strong> stood out with the <strong>highest percentage at 43.0%</strong>, reflecting its
                        strong concentration of professionals and public service employees. <strong>Victoria (29.2%) and New
                            South Wales (27.8%) also had relatively high proportions</strong>, indicating a well-educated
                        population in the two largest states. <strong>Western Australia (23.8%), South Australia (22.7%),
                            and Queensland (22.1%) had moderate levels</strong>, while <strong>Tasmania (21.9%) and the
                            Northern Territory (21.5%) had the lowest percentages</strong>, suggesting smaller shares
                        of degree holders in these regions. Overall, this data highlights the variation in
                        educational attainment across Australian states and territories, with urban and
                        administrative centers showing notably higher concentrations of tertiary-educated
                        individuals.
